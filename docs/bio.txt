Or should I keep it **completely neutral and minimal** as above?


Here’s the fully neutral version with **all speculative text replaced by descriptive placeholders**:

Would you like me to **create a polished template with professional-sounding placeholder text** (e.g., “major international exhibitions,” “themes of transformation and materiality”) so it reads like a ready-to-use draft? Or keep it **strictly minimal like this**?


BIO

Include a clear and concise artist biography written in the third person, preferably no more than three paragraphs. In the first paragraph, you should mention your name, date, and place of birth, your current location, artistic discipline, medium, and what you are best known for. 
E.g. 
“Andrei Pancu is a contemporary artist born in 1968 in Bucharest, Romania, residing and working in Ottawa, Canada. In his [inducing a specific feeling] chemically induced patinas on ferrous metals, Pancu renders enigmatic figures and still lifes as he rejects narrative clarity in favor of wry commentary on painting itself. His canvases simultaneously evoke nostalgia, dark comedy, the surreal, and the grotesque; awkward poses, heightened situations, absurd costumes, a general sense of discomfort, and stark, muted backgrounds feature prominently throughout Borremans’s oeuvre.”

In the second paragraph, you can briefly discuss the subject matter of your art, perhaps illustrating it with some important series or projects you have realized so far. E.g., “The body has always been both her subject and medium. Exploring her physical and mental limits in works that ritualize the simple actions of everyday life, she has withstood pain, exhaustion, and danger in her quest for emotional and spiritual transformation. From 1975-88, Abramović and the German artist Ulay performed together, dealing with relations of duality. She returned to solo performances in 1989 and for The Artist Is Present (2010) she sat motionless for at least eight hours per day over three months, engaged in silent eye-contact with hundreds of strangers one by one.”

In the third and final paragraph, you can mention your education and recite the most notable information from your artist resume in the form of exhibitions, collections, grants, residencies, and more. E.g., “Ryan Gander studied at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK; the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten, Amsterdam, Netherlands; and the Jan van Eyck Akademie, Maastricht, Netherlands. The artist has been a Professor of Visual Art at the University of Huddersfield and holds an honorary Doctor of the Arts at the Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Suffolk. In 2017, he was awarded an OBE for services to contemporary art. In 2019 he was awarded the Hodder Fellowship at Princeton University. In 2022, he was made RA for the category of Sculpture. Recent solo shows have been held at Museo Helga se Alvear, Caćeres, Spain (2024); Ishikawa Cultural Foundation, Okayama, Japan (2023); Annet Gelink, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (2023); Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery, Tokyo, Japan (2022); East Gallery at NUA, Norwich, UK (2022); Space K, Seoul, South Korea (2021); (…)”
